Currently, I cannot make any changes to the commit history because I am concerned that doing so might delete or alter the existing commit records. 
Since Iâ€™ve already completed the relevant tasks for this project, I don't want to risk losing the history or causing any unintended changes.
To confirm that I am the one making the commits, I have created a video presentation showing my work process and the steps I took. 
Please feel free to review the video as proof of my involvement and the authenticity of my contributions.
Thank you for your understanding, and I will make sure to address this issue in the future once I am able to safely modify the commit history if necessary.
